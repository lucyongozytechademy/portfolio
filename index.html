    <h2> About Me</h2>
     <img src="IMAGES/LUCY7.jpg" alt="Lucy Wanjiru image" width="400"/>
  <p>Welcome to My Creative World!
I'm Lucy Wanjiru Njoroge — a passionate <strong>journalist, writer, video editor, graphic designer and Data Analyst</strong>  based in Kenya.<br> With a sharp eye for detail and a love for storytelling through words and visuals, I craft compelling narratives that inform, inspire, and influence.</p> 
<p>I am a multimedia storyteller who thrives at the intersection of journalism, visual media, and community-based research. <br>With a background in journalism and criminology and years of field experience, I transform complex issues into engaging and accessible content. My creative and analytical approach allows me to communicate ideas powerfully through videos, graphics, and written reports.</p>
<p>Whether capturing voices in rural communities or visualizing data for non-profits, my mission is to amplify real stories that matter. I am fluent in English and Kiswahili, with working knowledge of French and Kikuyu, which enables me to connect across diverse audiences.</p> 
<p>I bring a unique blend of journalistic inquiry and multimedia design, backed by years of hands-on experience working on development, humanitarian, and research-driven projects.<br> I have collaborated with leading organizations including <em>Ongozy Technology, World Vision Kenya, Partnership for Economic Policy (PEP), and the International Potato Centre (CIP).</em> </p>
<p>Through these partnerships, I have documented real-world impact, captured human stories, and created compelling media that brings data,and communities to life.</p>
